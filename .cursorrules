# EasyLog Python Server - Agent Architecture Context

## Project Overview
This is the EasyLog Python server project that provides a flexible AI agent framework for building customized solutions for different clients. The system uses a modular architecture with agents, tools, roles, and workflows that can be configured per client requirements.

## Key Architecture Components

### Agent System
- **BaseAgent**: Core agent class with generic configuration support
- **Role-based Configuration**: Multiple roles per agent with specific permissions
- **Tool Integration**: Modular tool system with regex-based filtering
- **Super Agent**: Autonomous background system for scheduled tasks

### Current Agent Implementations
- **EasyLogAgent**: Production agent with comprehensive tools and 3-hour super agent interval
- **MUMCAgent**: Medical/healthcare focused agent with COPD-specific features
- **DebugAgent**: Development agent with 2-hour super agent interval and enhanced logging

### Tool Categories
- **EasyLog Backend Tools**: API access for companies, users, projects management
- **EasyLog SQL Tools**: Database query and schema access via SSH tunnel
- **Knowledge Graph Tools**: Document search and retrieval from knowledge base
- **Visualization Tools**: Chart creation (bar, line, ZLM charts for healthcare)
- **Communication Tools**: OneSignal notifications, multiple choice interactions
- **System Tools**: Memory, reminders, recurring tasks, file operations

### Client Solutions
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA-compliant with ZLM charts for COPD monitoring
- **E-commerce**: Order management, inventory tracking, sales analytics
- **Financial**: Fraud detection, risk analysis, compliance monitoring
- **Customer Service**: High-volume support with cost-effective models

### OpenRouter Integration
- **Models**: Uses OpenRouter.ai for access to 300+ AI models
- **Primary Models**: 
  - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` for premium/medical applications
  - `openai/gpt-4.1` for standard business use
  - `openai/gpt-4.1-mini` for cost-effective high-volume operations
- **Configuration**: Environment-based API key management

### Frontend Integration
- **Flutter Chat App**: User-facing chat interface that connects to Python agents
- **Widget Integration**: Agents generate widgets (charts, multiple choice) rendered in Flutter
- **Real-time Communication**: Streaming responses for progressive message rendering
- **Client Branding**: Customizable themes and layouts per client

## Documentation Files
Always reference these key documentation files when discussing architecture:
- `instructions/client-agent-configuration.md` - Complete client configuration guide
- `instructions/openrouter-configuration.md` - OpenRouter setup and Super Agent documentation

## Important Context
- This environment builds different solutions for different clients
- Security and compliance are critical (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX support)
- Multi-tenant architecture with client-specific configurations
- Performance optimization through appropriate model selection
- Monitoring and analytics for usage tracking and billing

## Development Context
**IMPORTANT**: The user is not a full developer but uses AI assistance to build and maintain this system. 

### Deployment Architecture
- **Local Development**: Code is developed locally and committed to the server
- **Production Server**: Accessible via `ssh easylog-python`
- **Server Access Rules**: 
  - **NEVER make changes to the server without explicit approval**
  - **Can monitor logs**: Use `ssh easylog-python "docker logs easylog-python-server.api -f"` for live monitoring
  - **Read-only monitoring**: Check server status, logs, and performance
  - **Changes require approval**: Always ask before executing any server modifications

Therefore:

### AI Assistant Guidelines
- **Be Comprehensive**: Provide complete, working code examples rather than snippets
- **Explain Reasoning**: Always explain why specific approaches are chosen
- **Be Proactive**: Suggest best practices, potential issues, and optimizations
- **Implementation Ready**: Generate code that can be used immediately without requiring additional development knowledge
- **Educational**: Explain technical concepts in accessible terms
- **Safety First**: Always consider security, compliance, and error handling
- **Test-Ready**: Provide examples that can be tested and validated

### Communication Style
- Focus on practical, working solutions
- Provide step-by-step implementation guides
- Explain technical trade-offs in business terms
- Suggest testing approaches and validation methods
- Always consider the broader impact on client solutions

## Technical Guidelines
- Agents inherit from BaseAgent[TConfig] with type-safe configuration
- Tools use async/await patterns and proper error handling
- Super agents run autonomously on configurable intervals
- All client data access uses proper authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control with regex filtering for tool permissions

When discussing any agent modifications, tool implementations, or client configurations, always consider:
1. Security and compliance requirements
2. Client-specific customization needs
3. Performance and cost implications
4. Integration with Flutter frontend
5. Super agent automation possibilities
6. Implementation complexity and maintainability
7. Testing and validation requirements
